To compile devFlowcharter you will need:
 - Delphi 7 (any edition)
 - stuff from ThirdParty\ThirdParty.zip. So unpack 
     FastCode, 
     FastMM4, 
     OmniXML, 
     Synedit,
     pngimage 
   directories and add to library paths in Delphi (Tools->Environment Options->Library->Library path).

If interested to add support for new programming language check LangTemplates\Pascal_Template.pas.
